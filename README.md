# Terraform Provider Plugin for Netbox

This repository holds a external plugin for a [Terraform][1] provider to manage
resources within [Netbox][2], an open source IP address management system. Using
the go API client for DigitalOcean's NetBox IPAM and DCIM service [Go-Netbox][3].

Good example: [Example][4]

## About Netbox

[Netbox][2] is an open source IP address management system written in Python. Through our Go integration provided by [Go-Netbox[3]], we will integrate it into
[Terraform][1], allowing for the management and lookup of sections, VLANs, subnets and IP addresses, entirely withing Terraform.


## Installing

See the [Plugin Basics][5] page of the Terraform docs to see how to plunk this
into your config. Check the [releases page][6] of this repo to get releases for
Linux, OS X, and Windows.

## Usage

After installation, to use the plugin, simply use any of its resources or data
sources (such as `netbox_prefixes`, `netbox_vlans` or `netbox_prefixes_available_ips` in a Terraform
configuration.

Credentials can be supplied via configuration variables to the `netbox`
provider instance, or via environment variables. These are documented in the
next section.

You can see the following example below for a simple usage example that reserves
the first available IP address in a subnet. This address could then be passed
along to the configuration for a VM, say, for example, a
[`vsphere_virtual_machine`][7] resource.

[7]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vsphere/r/virtual_machine.html

```
provider "netbox" {
  app_id = "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
  endpoint = "0.0.0.0:32768"
}

data "netbox_prefixes" "prefixes" {
  prefixes_id = 1
}

resource "netbox_prefixes_available_ips" "next_address" {
	prefixes_id = "${data.netbox_prefixes.prefixes.prefixes_id}"
	description = "IP requisitado via Terraform 20180827"
}
```

### Plugin Options

The options for the plugin are as follows:

 * `app_id` - The API application ID, configured in the NETBOX  panel. This
   application ID should have read/write access if you are planning to use the
   resources, but read-only access should be sufficient if you are only using
   the data sources. Caan also be supplied by the `NETBOX_APP_ID` environment
   variable.
 * `endpoint` - The server, protocol and port to access the NETBOX API, such as
   `https://netbox.example.com/api`. Can also be supplied by the
   `NETBOX_ENDPOINT_ADDR` environment variable.

### Data Sources

The following data sources are supplied by this plugin:

#### The `netbox_prefixes` Data Source

The `netbox_prefixes` cadastred on netbox

**Example:**

```
data "netbox_prefixes" "prefixes" {
  prefixes_id = 1
}
```

**Example With `description`:**

```
data "netbox_prefixes" "prefixes" {
  prefixes_id = 1
}

output "prefix_description" {
  value = "${data.netbox_prefixes.prefixes.description}"
}
```

**Example With `vlan id - vid`:**

```
data "netbox_prefix" "search_by_vid" {
  vlan = {
    vid = 16
  }
}

output "vlan_description" {
  value = "${data.netbox_prefixes.search_by_vid.name}"
}
```

##### Argument Reference

The data source takes the following parameters:

 * `address_id` - The ID of the IP address in the NETBOX database.
 * `description` - The description of the IP address. `subnet_id` is required
   when using this field.

⚠️  **NOTE:** `description`, `hostname`, and `custom_field_filter` fields return
the first match found without any warnings.

⚠️  **NOTE:** An empty or unspecified `custom_field_filter` value is the
equivalent to a regular expression that matches everything, and hence will
return the first address it sees in the subnet.

Arguments are processed in the following order of precedence:

 * `address_id`
 * `ip_address`
 * `subnet_id`, and either one of `description`, `hostname`, or
   `custom_field_filter`

##### Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

 * `description` - The description provided to this IP address.


#### The `netbox_vlans` Data Source

The `netbox_vlans` data source allows you to search for vlans_by_id

**Example:**

```
data "netbox_vlans" "search_by_vid" {
  vid = 16
}

output "vlans_description" {
  value = "${data.netbox_vlans.search_by_vid.description}"
}
```

```
data "netbox_vlans" "search_by_name" {
  name = "Vlan16"
}

output "vlans_description" {
  value = "${data.netbox_vlans.search_by_name.description}"
}
```

#### End
